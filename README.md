# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

Objective: Developed and deployed a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications
 setting.
 Implemented machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict customer
 churn.
 Conducted end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing customer churn.
 Achieved a 14% increase in prediction accuracy over previous models through hyperparameter tuning and
 ensemble techniques.
 Created and deployed a Flask-based API for real-time predictions, integrating the model with a user-friendly
 web interface
